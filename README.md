# cs2-performance-analyser

Woah testing 123. If you are reading this, then I have successfully edited this message
through git bash's nano editor which looks pretty cool.

Anyways, I am trying to use machine learning in order to analyse Counter-Strike 2
match data. It will be able to gather the player performance's and form a playstyle out of them (e.g. aggressive, defensive) and 
be able to predict an outcome for a match based on stats of the player. A little like FaceIT's own predictor.

## GOALS
- Gather player match stats to find playstyle patterns.
- Predict win/loss using match data.
- Visually see players performance.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- seaborn / matplotlib / plotly
- streamlit


## Data
data is stored in `data/cs2_matches.csv`

## How To Run
Soon.
